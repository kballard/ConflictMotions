DESCRIPTION
This plugin defines movement commands and text objects to go to and operate on
conflicting lines, as indicated by many revision control systems, like
Subversion, Git, etc. The source code management system inserts conflict
markers such as <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>> on merges to indicate that the
automatic resolution failed; this plugin helps you with locating and resolving
these conflicts.

RELATED WORKS
To be alerted to the existence of conflict markers and to visually
differentiate the conflicted lines, you can use the highlighting, warnings and
custom buffer status provided by the companion ConflictDetection.vim plugin
(vimscript #4129).
